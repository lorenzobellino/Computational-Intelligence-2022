# Lab 2
## Assignement
Solve the set-Covering problem using EA.

## UNCOMPLETED SOLUTION
Since i was sick for the past 4 days i was not able to finish the assignment. I will try to finish it as soon as possible.
however the file [setCovering.py](setCovering.py) contains the code for the setCovering problem. It is not complete but it is a good start.
I was not able to clean my code or produce a good enough solution for my standard.
If you have any suggestion or comment about my code feel free to open an issue but be aware that the code is not finished and in the current state it is not very readable.
I will update my solution as soon as I feel better.
