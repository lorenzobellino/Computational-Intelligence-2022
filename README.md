#### Peer reviewing
I was assigned to review the code produced by [Omid Mahdavii](https://github.com/OmidMahdavii/Computational-Intelligence-Course)
In order to review the code i created a fork of the original repository and created a new pull request [here](https://github.com/OmidMahdavii/Computational-Intelligence-Course/pull/1) improving some aspects of the code and suggesting some other changes
The other peer review were chosen randomly from the list of github repos provided by the professor.
