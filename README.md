#### Updates after review
waiting for review

#### Peer reviewing
In order to review the code produced by some of my peer i opened a pull request or used the Issues tool provided by github,improving some aspects of the code and suggesting some other changes
I was assigned to review the code produced by [Omid Mahdavii](https://github.com/OmidMahdavii/Computational-Intelligence-Course). The other peer review were chosen randomly from the list of github repos provided by the professor.

For this lab i reviewed:
- [Omid Mahdavii](https://github.com/OmidMahdavii/Computational-Intelligence-Course) forking his repo and creating a new pull request that can be found [here](https://github.com/OmidMahdavii/Computational-Intelligence-Course/pull/1)
- [Shayan Taghinezhad Roudbaraki](https://github.com/drustthecoder) using github Issues, my review can be found [here](https://github.com/drustthecoder/CI/issues/3)
- [RaminHedayatmehr](https://github.com/RaminHedayatmehr) also using github Issues, my review can be found [here](https://github.com/RaminHedayatmehr/CI-2022-23/issues/3)
