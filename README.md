# Computational-Intelligence-2022
## Repository for the course Computational Intelligence of the year 2022/2023

### LAB1
#### Solution
The original approach for the solution of lab1 is explained in the README [here](https://github.com/lorenzobellino/Computational-Intelligence-2022/blob/main/lab1/README.md)
#### Updates after review
After receiving the first review i tried to implement the suggestion proposed in te Issues of my peer, in particular i added:
- Added some usefull comment in my code other than the readme in order to make it more readable and understandable
- Changed my approach using an ad hoc class ```PrioritizedSet``` instead using a tuple representing ```(priority,list)```
- Added a file ```Dijkstra.py``` implementing a vanilla version of Dijkstra's algorithm in order to find a globally optimal solution for values of $N <= 20$

#### Peer reviewing
In order to review the code produced by some of my peer i opened a pull request or used the Issues tool provided by github,improving some aspects of the code and suggesting some other changes
I was assigned to review the code produced by [Omid Mahdavii](https://github.com/OmidMahdavii/Computational-Intelligence-Course). The other peer review were chosen randomly from the list of github repos provided by the professor.

For this lab i reviewed:
- [Omid Mahdavii](https://github.com/OmidMahdavii/Computational-Intelligence-Course) forking his repo and creating a new pull request that can be found [here](https://github.com/OmidMahdavii/Computational-Intelligence-Course/pull/1)
- [Shayan Taghinezhad Roudbaraki](https://github.com/drustthecoder) using github Issues, my review can be found [here](https://github.com/drustthecoder/CI/issues/3)
- [RaminHedayatmehr](https://github.com/RaminHedayatmehr) also using github Issues, my review can be found [here](https://github.com/RaminHedayatmehr/CI-2022-23/issues/3)
